# Drug-and-condition-recommendation
This project explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) for predicting drugs based on patient conditions and medical descriptions. The objective is to investigate modeling approaches that can process unstructured clinical text and identify potential treatment options, with a focus on experimentation and academic analysis rather than real-world deployment.

The work involves:

Text preprocessing — cleaning, tokenization, and normalization of medical text.

Feature extraction — exploring domain-specific embeddings such as BioBERT and ClinicalBERT.

Model development — training ML models for mapping patient conditions to likely drug recommendations.

Performance evaluation — using suitable metrics to assess predictive quality and generalization.

This is an ongoing research project designed for exploring methodologies, comparing model architectures, and understanding the challenges in medical text prediction tasks. It is not intended for clinical use or deployment, and results should be interpreted in an experimental context only.

Future directions include:

Expanding the dataset for better coverage of rare conditions.

Investigating ensemble and hybrid NLP–ML pipelines.

Applying explainable AI techniques to enhance interpretability of predictions.
